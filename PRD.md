## 6. Narrative
Sarah, a client onboarding specialist at a growing consulting firm, starts her Tuesday morning with three new clients to process. Instead of logging into DocuSign's complex interface and spending 20 minutes customizing fields for each client type, she opens the secure onboarding platform and selects her pre-built "Enterprise Client" template.

With a few clicks, she customizes the form fields for the specific client, adds their company logo to maintain brand consistency, and sends the personalized form via email. The entire process takes under 5 minutes per client.

Meanwhile, the new client receives a professional, branded email with a clear call-to-action. They click through to a clean, intuitive form that guides them step-by-step through providing necessary information. The progress bar shows they're 70% complete, and inline validation prevents any errors. After reviewing their information, they apply their certified e-signature with confidence, knowing the process is secure and legally binding.

Sarah receives an instant notification that the form is complete and can immediately begin the next phase of client onboarding, while the client receives a confirmation email with their completed documents and clear next steps.
